# Zomato Data Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze the Zomato dataset and extract meaningful insights from it. The dataset is taken from Kaggle and contains information about restaurants located in various cities across the world.

# Getting Started
- To get started with the project, you will need to have the following tools installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook (or any other similar tool)
- You will also need to install the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- To install these libraries, you can use the following command:

Copy code
- pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
- Dataset
The Zomato dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle using the following link:
